  LodeStar is a top-down shoot-em up for the PC that utilizes the state switch mechanic of Ikaruga along with a vibrant colourful art style that inserts the player into the role of a lone ship fighting to protect their lively world from the Gloom.
  
  As the pilot of the LodeStar, your mission is to deftly maneuver through the invading forces of the Gloom. Using stolen Gloomian S.H.I.F.T. technology you will transform your ship to break through their shields and defeat their commanders. Along the way you will salvage technology from their destroyed ships to gain greater fire power, better engines, and stronger defenses. As you venture further into Gloom territory, the light of the world shines dimmer and dimmer, and the strength of the Gloom armada grows more lethal. The Gloom will increase in numbers, fly faster, become more resistant, and fire more rapidly. To survive, you will have to master S.H.I.F.T. technology to weave through obstacles and enemy fire while piercing through the enemy lines.
