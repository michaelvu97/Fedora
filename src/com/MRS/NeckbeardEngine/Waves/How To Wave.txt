How to Wave

-Waves aren't instantiatable, but rather have a static method "unpack", which returns an ArrayList of spawnevents.

-It is important to include an integer "currentFrame" as a parameter
of "unpack", so that it can produce the proper SpawnEvents accordingly.

-SpawnEvents are checked in Level, so waves create use a delta-frame to produce the spawnevent's spawnframe.
 ex: Level.frame = 180. Level calls unpack(frame). unpack has two
     mooks, one delayed by 30 frames. unpack returns two spawn 
     events, both with mooks, the first with a spawnFrame of 180,
     and the second with a spawnFrame of 180 + 30.

     Then, in level, theres is a constant loop that checks through
     its list of SpawnEvents, and checks if the currentFrame is past
     or equal to the spawnFrame. If true, it spawns the target enemy
     into the game, and removes the event.

-Waves can use other waves too by unpacking other waves into their own unpack method, however, time modifications may need to be made
